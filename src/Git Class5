What is the stashing?

saving our codes to a temproray area for later use is called stashing!!

whay do we need stashing?

1.you are working on a new test feature that you don't want yet to be in the commits because you are not sure wther it
will be working or not!!

2. in order to update your local repo in sync with the remote repo, without discarding the changes in working directory!!
